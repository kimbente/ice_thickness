The field resulting from the \textbf{row-wise divergence} of an antisymmetric Jacobian matrix is \textbf{not necessarily divergence-free}. To understand why, let's break down the key concepts:

\section*{Recap of the Row-Wise Divergence}

We are considering the \textbf{row-wise divergence} of the antisymmetric matrix \( J_{\text{antisym}} \), which has the following form:

\[
\text{Row-wise divergence of } J_{\text{antisym}} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^2 y_2}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \\
\frac{\partial^2 y_2}{\partial x_1^2} - \frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\section*{Divergence-Free Condition}

A vector field is \textbf{divergence-free} if:

\[
\text{div}(\mathbf{v}) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0.
\]

That means the sum of the partial derivatives of each component of the vector field with respect to its corresponding coordinates must equal zero.

\section*{Examining the Row-Wise Divergence}

To check if the resulting field is divergence-free, let's evaluate the \textbf{divergence of the resulting vector field}.

The vector field resulting from the row-wise divergence of \( J_{\text{antisym}} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^2 y_2}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \\
\frac{\partial^2 y_2}{\partial x_1^2} - \frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, let's compute the divergence of this vector field:

\[
\text{div}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} \left( \frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^2 y_2}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} \left( \frac{\partial^2 y_2}{\partial x_1^2} - \frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \right).
\]

Expanding this:

\[
\text{div}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\partial^3 y_1}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^3 y_2}{\partial x_1^2 \partial x_2} + \frac{\partial^3 y_2}{\partial x_1^2 \partial x_2} - \frac{\partial^3 y_1}{\partial x_1^2 \partial x_2}.
\]

Simplifying this:

\[
\text{div}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\partial^3 y_1}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^3 y_1}{\partial x_1^2 \partial x_2} - \frac{\partial^3 y_1}{\partial x_1^2 \partial x_2} + \frac{\partial^3 y_1}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2^2} = 0.
\]

Thus, the \textbf{divergence of the resulting field is zero}.

\section*{Conclusion}

Yes, the resulting field is \textbf{divergence-free}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The key property of antisymmetric matrices, particularly those related to vector fields and their derivatives, means that interactions between components lead to a \textbf{conservation of flow}, which results in a \textbf{divergence-free vector field}.
    \item In the context of fluid dynamics or other physical systems, this would imply that the flow is \textbf{incompressible} in the sense that there is no net "expansion" or "contraction" at any point in the field.
\end{itemize}


### HNN

The rotational velocity (or vorticity) of a vector field \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2) \) in 2D is given by the curl:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_1} - \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_2}
\]

For a velocity field constructed from a scalar potential \( H(x_1, x_2) \), where:

\[
v_1(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_2}, \quad v_2(x_1, x_2) = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1}
\]

The curl becomes:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} \left( -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1} \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_2} \right)
\]

Using the symmetry of mixed partial derivatives, we get:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = 0
\]

Thus, the rotational velocity (or vorticity) of this velocity field is zero.
